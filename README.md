# The Libft Project

The Libft project is a fundamental project in the 42 curriculum. It involves creating a library of useful functions that can be used in future projects. The goal of the Libft project is to recreate some standard C library functions, as well as implement additional functions that can be helpful in various programming tasks.

## Library Functions

The library includes functions for manipulating strings, working with memory, performing mathematical operations, and more. By completing the Libft project, students gain a deeper understanding of these fundamental concepts and improve their programming skills.

| **Libc functions #1** | **Libc functions #2** | **Libc functions #3** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| * ft_strlen	| * ft_isalpha | * ft_toupper |
| * ft_memcpy	| * ft_isdigit | * ft_tolower |
| * ft_memset	| * ft_isalnum | * ft_strchr |
| * ft_bzero	| * ft_isascii | * ft_strrchr |
| * ft_memmove	| * ft_isprint ||
| * ft_memcmp |||
| * ft_memchr |||

| **Libc functions #4** | **Additional functions #1** | **Additional functions #2** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| * ft_strlcat | * ft_substr | * ft_strmapi |
| * ft_strlcpy | * ft_strjoin | * ft_striteri |
| * ft_atoi | * ft_putchar_fd | * ft_strtrim |
| * ft_strnstr | * ft_putstr_fd | * ft_split |
| * ft_strncmp | * ft_putendl_fd | * ft_itoa |
| * ft_calloc | * ft_putnbr_fd | |
| * ft_strdup | | |


## Bonus Functions

The Libft project also includes a bonus section, which involves implementing additional functions that can be useful in future projects. These functions are not required for the project, but they are a great way to practice writing more complex code and gain experience in creating your own library of useful functions.

| **Bonus functions #1**|

| --- | --- | --- |
|* ft_lstnew | * ft_lstdelone | * ft_lstclear |
|* ft_lstadd_front | * ft_lstadd_back | * ft_lstsize |
|* ft_lstlast | * ft_lstiter | * ft_lstmap |



## Benefits of the Libft Project

The Libft project is an excellent opportunity to practice writing efficient and reusable code. It also serves as a foundation for many other projects in the 42 curriculum, as the library functions can be used as building blocks for more complex programs.

## Conclusion

Overall, the Libft project is a crucial step in becoming a proficient programmer, as it helps students develop a strong foundation in C programming and gain experience in creating their own library of useful functions.
